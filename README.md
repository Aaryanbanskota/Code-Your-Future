# 🚀 Code Your Future

**Learn. Practice. Build. Repeat. — Together.**

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **Code Your Future**, a platform I’m building **as I learn to code myself**. This isn’t just another tutorial site—it’s my learning journey transformed into a structured experience where we can **learn together**.  

Right now, I’m deep in **JavaScript**, but I’ll expand to other languages and technologies as I master them.
